The Challenge
Current Limitations
Deep learning achieves high accuracy but requires massive computational resources and millions of
parameters, creating barriers for resource-constrained clinical settings.

Core Technology
SWAP-test based distance classifier computing fidelity between test images and learned class
prototypes through quantum interference.

Our Innovation
A truly measurement-free quantum classifier preserving quantum coherence throughout
classification, avoiding wavefunction collapse that limits conventional quantum ML approaches.

Key Research Insights
Measurement-Free Advantage
SWAP-test protocols preserve quantum advantage by avoiding
wavefunction collapse that destroys entanglement.

Parameter Efficiency

40-60% parameter reduction vs. classical CNNs while maintaining
comparable accuracy.

NISQ Feasibility

50-200 gate circuits practical for near-term implementation on
current quantum hardware.

Noise Resilience: Quantum noise in NISQ devices provides natural
denoising benefits for medical imaging. Measurement-free approaches
preserve this advantage throughout the pipeline.

Classical Feature Extraction
Lightweight CNN (3-4 conv layers) extracts 16-32D feature vectors
from 96×96 RGB histopathology patches.

Amplitude Encoding
Features normalized to [0,1] and encoded into quantum states using 45 qubits, preserving relationships through superposition.

SWAP-Test Classification
Quantum fidelity computed between test state and learned
benign/malignant prototypes through quantum interference.

Single Measurement
Only ancilla qubit measured at end. Probability encodes fidelity,
enabling binary classification decision.

Core Innovation: SWAP-Test Protocol
Why Measurement-Free?
Coherence Preservation

Fidelity-Based Decision

Quantum states never
collapsed until final readout,
maintaining entanglement
throughout.

The SWAP-test computes quantum overlap
between test image and class prototypes:

Noise Resilience
Fewer measurement points
reduce error accumulation on
NISQ hardware.

Quantum Advantage

Classification Logic:
If Fidelity_benign > Fidelity_malignant:
Predict: BENIGN (0)
Else:
Predict: MALIGNANT (1)

Preserves superposition and
interference effects that
enhance classification.
