# ISDO Training Regimes — Implementation Plan & Tracking Summary

## Scope

These regimes **build on Direction 1 (ISDO)**, which is **closed**.
They **do not modify**:

* the ISDO observable
* the ISDO circuit (B′)

They only define **how class states are constructed and updated**.

---

## Shared Foundations (Applies to All Regimes)

### Fixed Components (Never Trained)

* **Quantum circuit**: ISDO-B′ (transition-based interference)
* **Measurement**: ancilla $\langle Z\rangle$
* **Decision rule**:
  $$
  \hat{y}(x) = \operatorname{sign}\big(\operatorname{Re}\langle \chi \mid \psi(x)\rangle\big)
  $$

### Learned Objects

* **Quantum class state(s)** $|\chi\rangle$
* These are the **only trainable parameters**

### Data Pipeline

```
image
  → CNN
  → embedding ($\mathbb{R}^{32}$)
  → L2 normalize
  → $|\psi\rangle$
  → ISDO($|\psi\rangle$, $|\chi\rangle$)
```

---

# Regime 1 — Static Prototype Aggregation (Baseline)

### Purpose

* Non-iterative baseline
* Fast, stable, interpretable
* Already implemented and validated

---

### Definition

Given labeled embeddings:

* Class +1: $\{|\phi_k^+\rangle\}$
* Class −1: $\{|\phi_k^-\rangle\}$

Construct:

$$
\boxed{
|\chi\rangle
= \operatorname{normalize}\left(
\sum_k |\phi_k^+\rangle - \sum_k |\phi_k^-\rangle
\right)
}
$$

---

### Implementation Steps

1. Collect embeddings per class
2. Optionally cluster (KMeans) → prototypes
3. Sum positive prototypes
4. Subtract negative prototypes
5. Normalize → class state $|\chi\rangle$

### Inference

For each test sample:
$$
s = \operatorname{Re}\langle \chi | \psi \rangle
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\hat{y} = \operatorname{sign}(s)
$$

---

### Properties

| Aspect        | Status    |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Training      | One-shot  |
| Updates       | None      |
| Stability     | Very high |
| Circuit depth | Fixed     |
| QML validity  | Yes       |
| Novelty       | Moderate  |

---

### When to Use

* Baseline comparisons
* Low-data regimes
* Cold-start initialization for Regime 2 or 3

---

# Regime 2 — Online / Incremental ISDO Training (Recommended Core)

### Purpose

* Enable **learning over time**
* Adapt class state to data distribution
* Avoid gradients, shots, or parameterized circuits

This is the **quantum perceptron regime**.

---

### Initialization (Cold Start)

Option A — Zero state:
$$
|\chi_0\rangle = |0\rangle^{\otimes n}
$$

Option B — Bootstrap (recommended):
$$
\boxed{
|\chi_0\rangle
= \operatorname{normalize}\left(
\sum_{i=1}^{K} y_i |\psi_i\rangle
\right)
}
$$

---

### Online Update Rule

For each training sample $(|\psi\rangle, y)$, with $y \in \{+1, -1\}$:

1. Measure:
   $$
   s = \operatorname{Re}\langle \chi_t | \psi \rangle
   $$

2. If correctly classified:
   ```text
   y · s ≥ 0  →  no update
   ```

3. If misclassified:
   $$
   \boxed{
   |\chi_{t+1}\rangle
   = \operatorname{normalize}\left(
   |\chi_t\rangle + \eta \cdot y |\psi\rangle
   \right)
   }
   $$

---

### Implementation Notes

* Update is **classical vector arithmetic**
* Renormalize after every update
* Learning rate $\eta$ can be:
  * constant
  * decaying
  * adaptive

### Properties

| Aspect           | Status        |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Training         | Online        |
| Updates          | Deterministic |
| Gradients        | None          |
| Circuit          | Fixed         |
| Shot cost        | Minimal       |
| Interpretability | High          |
| QML validity     | Strong        |

---

### When to Use

* Continual learning
* Streaming data
* Non-stationary datasets
* As the **main learning regime**

---

# Regime 3 — Multi-State Quantum Memory (Advanced / Nonlinear)

### Purpose

* Increase expressivity
* Approximate nonlinear decision boundaries
* Avoid deep circuits or kernels

This is **ensemble learning in Hilbert space**.

---

### Model Structure

Maintain a set of class states:
$$
\mathcal{M} = \{ |\chi^{(1)}\rangle, \dots, |\chi^{(M)}\rangle \}
$$

Each state:
* initialized independently
* trained independently (Regime 2 rule)

### Inference Rule

For input $|\psi\rangle$:
$$
s_j = \operatorname{Re}\langle \chi^{(j)} | \psi \rangle
$$

Decision:
$$
\hat{y} = \operatorname{sign}\left(\max_j s_j\right)
$$

---

### Training Variants

**Variant A — Winner-updates**

* Only the best-matching (|\chi^{(j)}\rangle) is updated

**Variant B — All-updates**

* All memory states updated with different learning rates

**Variant C — Pruned memory**

* Periodically discard low-utility states

---

### Properties

| Aspect           | Status         |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| Expressivity     | High           |
| Circuit depth    | Fixed          |
| Parameters       | Quantum states |
| Interpretability | Medium         |
| QML novelty      | Very high      |
| Complexity       | Moderate       |

---

### When to Use

* Nonlinear class boundaries
* Multimodal class distributions
* Few-shot / continual learning

# Relationship Between Regimes

```
Regime 1
  ↓ (initialization)
Regime 2
  ↓ (parallelization)
Regime 3
```

* Regime 1 feeds Regime 2
* Regime 2 generalizes to Regime 3
* No regime invalidates ISDO

---

# Key Constraints (Must Not Violate)

* ❌ Do NOT train gate parameters
* ❌ Do NOT introduce variational ansätze
* ❌ Do NOT change the ISDO observable
* ✅ Always renormalize class states
* ✅ Updates must be linear combinations of embeddings

---

# Final Status Summary

| Regime   | Purpose             | Status             |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Regime 1 | Static baseline     | Implemented        |
| Regime 2 | Online learning     | Ready to implement |
| Regime 3 | Nonlinear extension | Defined            |

---

### Recommended Next Action

👉 **Implement Regime 2 end-to-end** on your existing embeddings and log:

* accuracy vs time
* number of updates
* stability of $|\chi\rangle$

Once Regime 2 is stable, Regime 3 becomes trivial.
